> Appshaper is a complete open source solution for building professional-quality web apps.

Appshaper is a modular library with an open architecture. It provides you with AMD modules that are
typically used when building web apps and exposes hooks that allow you to easily swap components.
This means you can use Appshaper modules to build your app, but it's also easy to combine Appshaper
modules with third party modules or your own custom modules.
